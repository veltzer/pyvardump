improve the symlink install operation to be smarter:
- don't install every symlink.
	- If the symlink already exists and is pointing at the right
	place then do nothing.
	- If the symlink already exists and is pointing at the wrong
	place then remove it and put the right symlink in.
	- If the symlink doesn't exists then install the new symlink.
- check if there are old symlinks to remove
	scan the target folder and for every symlink that points
	to the source folder that is not currently available - remove
	that symlink.
